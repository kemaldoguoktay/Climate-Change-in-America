# Climate-Change-in-America

The repository includes the data which contains surface tempatures changes in America.

I created this repository for learning how to use Git, Github, and Visual studio code.

I got the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawadawan/global-warming-trends-1961-2022?resource=download&select=wide_format_annual_surface_temp.csv
